## Formula 1 TV Leaderboard App for Assetto Corsa

App for our assetto corsa Formula 1 championship.

Can be tweaked for other championships using the "teams.ini" file.

During the race a file is saved, that will be read by the app during a race replay to be able to load the whole UI again. However currently **it only saves different files for each combination of track and car**.

## teams.ini configuration

Each line contains the following information about each driver in order separated by a colon "`:`"

- Team Name
- Name of the image files inside `ui/teams/` and `ui/cars/` with the team color (without file extension)
- Name of the image files inside `ui/numbers/` (without file extension)
- Driver Name
