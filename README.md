## Formula 1 TV Leaderboard App for Assetto Corsa

App for our assetto corsa Formula 1 championship.

Can be tweaked for other championships using the "teams.ini" file.

During the race it saves a file that can be read when replaying the race to be able to load the whole UI again.

## STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!


## teams.ini configuration

Each line contains the following information about each driver in order separated by a colon "`:`"

- Team Name
- Name of the image files inside `ui/teams/` and `ui/cars/` with the team color (without file extension)
- Name of the image files inside `ui/numbers/` (without file extension)
